<h2>Mod 17: Time Value of Money</h2><i>p 595 - 629</i>
    <b>Time Value of Money</b>
        <b>TVM (Time Value of Money)</b>
    <b>Mastering TVM concepts - IRR</b>
        <b>Internal Rate of Return (IRR)</b> - must exceed the cost of capital to add shareholder value
        <b>Net Present Value (NPV)</b>
        <b>Hurdle Rates</b> - minimum rate of return on a project needed 
    <b>Mastering TVM concepts - WACC</b>    
        <b>Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)</b>
    <b>How Net Present Value (NPV) Relates to the Time Value of Money</b>
        <b>Net Present Value (NPV)</b>
    <b>NPV and Opportunity Cost</b>
        <b>Opportunity costs</b>
    <b>Future Value</b>
        <b>Future Value</b> - value of asset at a specific date (future date ??)
        <b>Future Value Single Sum</b>
            <b><i>Rate</i></b> - interest / number of periods (ex: 6% / 4 quarterly payments)
            <b><i>Nper</i></b> - number of payment periods
            <b><i>Pmt</i></b>  - payment made each period. Does NOT change over the time of the loan
            <b><i>PV</i></b>   - present value
            <b><i>Type</i></b> - cash flow at end of period, or beginning of next period
    <b>Future Value Single Sum Calculations</b>
        <b>Future Value calculations</b>
    <b>Future Value - Positive and Negative Numbers</b>
        <b>Positive</b> - if the PV (present value) is positive the FV will be negative
        <b>Negative</b> - vice versa of above
    <b>Future Value Future Single Sum with Quarterly Compounding</b> 
        ex: if you DEPOSIT $100 in an account earning 6 percent interest for 5 years with interest compounding quarterly:
           Nper = 20 (5 years * 4 quarterly interest payments)
           Rate = .015 (6% interest / 4 quarterly interest payments)
    <b>Future Value Future Single Sum with Monthly Compounding</b>
        ex: $100 DEPOSIT at monthly compounding interest     
            Nper = 60 (5 years * 12 monthly interest payments)
            Rate = .005 (6% interest / 12 monthly interest payments)
    <b>Present Value</b>
        <b>Present Value (PV)</b> aka 'Discounted Value' = measures worth of money or stream of payments adjusted for interest and inflation
    <b>Present Value Single Sum Calculation</b>    
        ex: you RECEIVE $100 one year from now, what is the PV of $100 if you use a 6% interest or discount rate?
            the Final Value (FV) = $100, there is 6% interest (.06) with 1 pay period (Nper)
            the PV = $94.34 
    <b>Present Value Single Sum Calculation - 5 Year</b>
        ex: RECEIVE $100 in five years, what is the PV @ 6% interest?
            the FV = $100, there 6% interest with 5 pay periods (Nper)
            the PV = $74.73
    <b>Present Value Single Sum Calculation - 15 Years</b>
        ex: RECEIVE $1000 in 15 years, what is the PV @ 7% interest?
            FV = $1000, Nper = 15, Rate = .07
            PV = $362.45 
    <b>Interest Rate</b> 
        <b>Interest Rate</b> - stated at percent, amount charged to borrower for using lender's money (principal) 
        <b>Interest Rate Calculations</b> - return the interest rate per period of loan or investment. 
    <b>Interest Rate Calculation</b>
        ex: If you sold land for $11,933 that you bought for $5,000 5 years ago, what would your annual rate of return be?
            FV = 11,933, Nper = 5, Rate = ?
            PV = -5,000
            the rate comes out to 19%
    <b>Number of Periods (NPER)</b>
        <b>Number of Periods</b> = returns the number of payment periods for a loan
    <b>Payments</b>
        <b>Payment</b> - transfer of goods, services, or financial asset for another form of good, service, or financial restitution
    <b>Effective Interest Rate</b>
        <b>Effective Interest Rate</b> - amount paid on loan due to compounding interest over time
    <b>Ordinary Annuity</b>
        <b>Annuity</b>
        <b>Ordinary Annuity</b>
    <b>Total Value of Money (TVM) Annuities</b>
        <b>Total Value of Money (TVM)</b> - 
    <b>Ordinary Annuity vs Annuity Due</b>
        <b>Ordinary Annuity</b>
            - Capital budget project for corporation
            - Home mortgage / Auto note
            - End of month savings
        <b>Annuity Due</b>
            - Life insurance / home owner insurance
            - apartment rent
            - Beginning of month savings
    <b>Present Value Ordinary Annuity</b>
    <b>Future Value Ordinary Annuity</b>
    <b>Ordinary Annuity vs Annuity Due II</b>
        <b>Ordinary Annuity Examples</b>
        <b>Annuities Due</b>
        <b>Cash flow for PMT can occur: </b> 
            - At the end (0) of the period for ordinary annuities
            - Beginning (1) of a period for annuity due 
    <b>Uneven Cash Flows in Annuities</b>
    <b>Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR)</b>
        <b>NPV</b> - total present value of the annual net cash flows - the initial cash outlay
        <b>IRR</b> - rate that makes the PV of net cash flows = 0 (zero) NPV
            <b>DECISION RULE:</b>
                - if NPV is positive +, ACCEPT
                - if NPV is negative -, REJECT
