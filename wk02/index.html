<h2>Mod 01: Investigating MIS (Management Information Systems) <i>p 35-65</i></h2>
<b>Why Learn MIS (Management Information Systems)</b>
<b>Impact of MIS on Management Theory</b>
<b>Early Management Theorists: The 1700s</b>
    <b>John Locke</b> - <i>Father of Liberalism</i>, <i>Life equals property</i><b><i>Theory of Property</i></b> = property ownership is created through exerting work onto nature resources
        since people own themselves then they also own the outcomes of their labor. People work because they expect an increase in wealth
    <b>Adam Smith</b> - <i>Father of Economics</i>, division of labor and free enterprise as keys to individual wealth. 
        Belived the wealth of the nation is dependent on the wealth of the individuals of that nation.
        concept of the <b><i>Invisible Hand</i></b> = individuals and businesses determine voluntarily what to buy and sell
        <ol>
            <li>Individuals specialize and become invreasingly dexterous in performing one simple task.</li>
            <li>Decreasing the space between each task required to manufacture a product invreases efficiency.</li>
            <li>Invention of machines that multiply the effectiveness of each individual increases individual productivity.</li>
        </ol>
<b>Management Theorists in the 1800s</b>
    <b>Frederick Taylor</b> - 'Scientific Management'; <b><i>The Principles of Scientific Management</i></b>
        <ol>
            <li>Every work element should be studied for improvement</li>
            <li>Workers should be scientifically recruited, selected, and trained</li>
            <li>Managers should cooperate with workers</li>
            <li>Managers should work as hard as employees</li>
        </ol>
    <b>Henri Fayol</b>
        <ul>14 Guiding Priniciples
            <li>Division</li>
            <li>Authority</li>
            <li>Discipline</li>
            <li>Unity of Command</li>
            <li>Unity of Direction</li>
            <li>Subordination of Individual Interest</li>
            <li>Remuneration</li>
            <li>Centralization and Decentralization</li>
            <li>Scalar Chain</li>
            <li>Order</li>
            <li>Equity</li>
            <li>Stability of Tenure</li>
            <li>Initiative</li>
            <li>Espirit de Corps</li>
        </ul>
    <b>Max Weber</b> - <b><i>The Puritan Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1905)</i></b>; 
        <ul>9 Principles of Organizational division:
            <li>Specialization</li>
            <li>Recruitment based on Competency</li>
            <li>Fairness and Uniformity</li>
            <li>Employment Stability</li>
            <li>Hierarcy</li>
            <li>Discipline and Authority</li>
            <li>Sumpremecy of Abstract Rules</li>
            <li>Authority</li>
            <li>Political Neutrality</li>
        </ul>
<b>Management Theorists in the 1900s</b>
    <b>Mary Parker Follett</b> - importance of relationships and informal processes within communication
        Competence and expertise were the sources of true power in organizations; conflict between managers and employees could be resolved through communication and integration
    <b>Elton Mayo</b> - <b><i>The Human Problems of an Industrialized Civilization (1933)</i></b> - importance of human on productivity
        Pay attention to employee motivation and interpersonal relationships. 
        Employees need to feel they are significant value, otherwise they become fatigued and less productive.
    <b>Douglas McGregor</b> - <b><i>The Human Side of Enterprise</i></b> - manager behavior is reflective of their attitude towards employees
        <b>Theory X Manager</b> - belive employees must be observed and controlled 
        <b>Theory Y Manager</b> - workers can be trusted and empowered 
    <b>Peter Drucker</b> - <b>Guru of Mangement</b>; primary responsibility of corporation is to serve customers and that profit is merely a condition for sustainability
        <ul>Corporations work best when:
            <li>They are decentralized</li>
            <li>They outsource work in which they do not have a comparative advantage</li>
            <li>Focus on areas in which they have a comparative advantage (their core business)</li>
        </ul>
<b>The Continuing Evolution of MIS</b>
