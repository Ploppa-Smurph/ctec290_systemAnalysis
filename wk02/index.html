<b>Why Learn MIS (Management Information Systems)</b>
<b>Impact of MIS on Management Theory</b>
<b>Early Management Theorists: The 1700s</b>
    <b>John Locke</b> - <i>Father of Liberalism</i>, <i>Life equals property</i><b><i>Theory of Property</i></b> = property ownership is created through exerting work onto nature resources
        since people own themselves then they also own the outcomes of their labor. People work because they expect an increase in wealth
    <b>Adam Smith</b> - <i>Father of Economics</i>, division of labor and free enterprise as keys to individual wealth. 
        Belived the wealth of the nation is dependent on the wealth of the individuals of that nation.
        concept of the <b><i>Invisible Hand</i></b> = individuals and businesses determine voluntarily what to buy and sell
        <ol>
            <li>Individuals specialize and become invreasingly dexterous in performing one simple task.</li>
            <li>Decreasing the space between each task required to manufacture a product invreases efficiency.</li>
            <li>Invention of machines that multiply the effectiveness of each individual increases individual productivity.</li>
        </ol>
<b>Management Theorists in the 1800s</b>
    <b>Frederick Taylor</b> - 'Scientific Management'; <b><i>The Principles of Scientific Management</i></b>
        <ol>
            <li>Every work element should be studied for improvement</li>
            <li>Workers should be scientifically recruited, selected, and trained</li>
            <li>Managers should cooperate with workers</li>
            <li>Managers should work as hard as employees</li>
        </ol>

        </ul>
<b>Management Theorists in the 1900s</b>
    <b>Mary Parker Follett</b> - importance of relationships and informal processes within communication
        Competence and expertise were the sources of true power in organizations; conflict between managers and employees could be resolved through communication and integration
    <b>Elton Mayo</b> - <b><i>The Human Problems of an Industrialized Civilization (1933)</i></b> - importance of human on productivity
        Pay attention to employee motivation and interpersonal relationships. 
        Employees need to feel they are significant value, otherwise they become fatigued and less productive.
    <b>Douglas McGregor</b> - <b><i>The Human Side of Enterprise</i></b> - manager behavior is reflective of their attitude towards employees
        <b>Theory X Manager</b> - belive employees must be observed and controlled 
        <b>Theory Y Manager</b> - workers can be trusted and empowered 
    <b>Peter Drucker</b> - <b>Guru of Mangement</b>; primary responsibility of corporation is to serve customers and that profit is merely a condition for sustainability
        <ul>Corporations work best when:
            <li>They are decentralized</li>
            <li>They outsource work in which they do not have a comparative advantage</li>
            <li>Focus on areas in which they have a comparative advantage (their core business)</li>
        </ul>

<h3>Traditional Case Study - Investigating MIS</h3>
    <b>01) Why did Twitter issue guidance on transitioning to a must work from home workforce model and offer reimbursement perks for employees making this change?</b>
        <i>Transitioning to a WFH model is a big organizational change and clear guidance and employee incentives are essential tools in ensuring the change is successful.</i>
        
    <b>02) How is an organization’s data and intellectual property put at risk in moving to a remote workforce model?</b>
        <i>Moving data across public networks and allowing data to reside on the PCs of a geographically dispersed workforce adds risk to safeguarding an organization’s data and intellectual property.</i>

    <b>03) How does the fact that Twitter’s employees are “knowledge workers” impact Twitter’s decision to move to a remote workforce model?</b>
        <i>“Knowledge workers” tend to produce nontangible work products, which eliminates or at least reduces the need for a physical presence in the workplace.</i>

    <b>04) Was the adoption of a remote workforce model Twitter’s only option in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic?</b>
        <i>Assuming Twitter obtained regulatory approval to continue operations as an “essential business,” Twitter could have required the use of masks and social distancing during the workday and otherwise continued business operations as they had been prior to the pandemic.</i>

    <b>05) From a business perspective, what are a few of the main risks and benefits of Twitter adopting a remote workforce business model?</b>
        <i>The main risks of a remote workforce model include elevated levels of exposure for the loss of data and intellectual property due to a distributed workforce, and potential negative impacts to employee productivity and comradery. The main benefits include possible increases in employee morale and potential reductions in office campus costs.</i>

    <b>06) From an employee perspective, what concerns might Twitter’s employees have in changing to a remote workforce model?</b>
        <i>- A remote workforce employee concern is that the tone and humor of electronic communications can easily be misinterpreted.
           - A downside to a remote workforce model is that employees working in geographic isolation from one another may not feel they are part of “the team” and may not develop a sense of comradery with their coworkers.
           - Connectivity and system access are significant concerns for a remote workforce.
           All of the answers are correct.</i>
